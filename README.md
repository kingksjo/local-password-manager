# Local Password Manager for Desktop

## Project Overview

This project is a **Local Password Manager** desktop application developed using **Tkinter**, Python's standard library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The application offers a convenient solution for managing and securely storing passwords locally, eliminating the need for cloud-based storage. It empowers users to generate, store, and retrieve strong passwords easily, reducing the reliance on weak or reused credentials.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Tkinter**: Used to create the graphical user interface.
- **Pyperclip**: Enables clipboard functionality for easier password management.

## Features

- **Save Custom Credentials**: Store website names, usernames, and passwords securely.
- **Password Generator**: Generate strong, random passwords to enhance account security.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly retrieve stored credentials with the search feature.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copy passwords to your clipboard for seamless use.

## Installation Guide

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. Tkinter is typically included with Python. If not, install it:
    
    ```bash
    pip install tkinter
    ```
    
2. Install the `pyperclip` library for clipboard support:
    
    ```bash
    pip install pyperclip
    ```
    
3. Run the application:
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    

## How It Works

The app utilizes a JSON file to store credentials locally. Users can:

- Save the name of a website, the corresponding username/email, and the password (either manually entered or auto-generated).
- Search for saved credentials by entering the website name, which prompts the app to display the associated username/email and offer to copy the password to the clipboard.

This design ensures that your passwords remain securely stored on your device, with no dependency on external cloud services.

## Future Enhancements

- **Authentication**: Implement device-specific authentication methods like Windows Hello, Touch ID, or passkeys.
- **Database Storage**: Replace JSON storage with a secure database like SQLite for enhanced security and disaster recovery.
- **Password Monitoring**: Integrate a feature to monitor saved passwords for breaches or vulnerabilities.
- **Desktop Notifications**: Notify users when a password breach is detected.
- **Dark Mode**: Provide a dark theme for improved accessibility in low-light conditions.

## Conclusion

This Password Manager is a robust, user-friendly solution for managing passwords securely and efficiently on a local device. Its simplicity and functionality make it an ideal tool for anyone prioritizing privacy and security. Future iterations aim to enhance security measures, provide a richer user experience, and adapt to evolving user needs.
